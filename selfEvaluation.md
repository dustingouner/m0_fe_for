# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement? 

I struggled with this assignment. If it wasn't for the help of my groups video's I'm not sure I would have finished. 

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? 

On the 2nd challenge I was able to find the solution and work the problem out myself. For the other two I had to watch my groups videos for help. I did struggle with finding a solution by researching online. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice more exercises and also learn how to research solutions faster. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

How should someone with no experience in javascript tackle this problem? If I am struggling with the exercise should I first reach out to my teacher or group members?
